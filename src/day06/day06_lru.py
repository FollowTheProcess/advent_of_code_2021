My first solution worked totally fine for part 1, but exploded my RAM on part 2!

So here I played around for ages using numpy and all sorts of crap to get it
to work without incinerating my laptop, all to no avail.

So I confess to a bit of cheating, I looked at the subreddit for some help.
In my head the cheating is fine because my logic was correct but my implementation
needed optimising ðŸ‘€
